GWClassifier
============

A Decision Tree Classifier with GA based  feature selection.



Machine Learning techniques have been applied to the eld of classification for more
than a decade. Machine Learning techniques can learn normal and anomalous patterns
from training data and generate classifiers, which can be used to capture characteristics
of interest. In general, the input data to classifiers is an extremely large set of features,
but not all of features are relevant to the classes to be classified. Hence, the learner must
generalize from the given examples in order to produce a useful output in new cases.

 Our Project, titled Decision Tree Classifier with Genetic Algorithm-based Feature Selection is
aimed at developing a complete program that constructs an optimal decision tree, based
on any kind of data set, divided into training and testing examples, by selecting only a
subset of features to classify data.

Although our program works with generic data samples, it must be noted that when
we started this project, our main intention was to classify ground water samples into
two classes, namely Potable and Non-Potable Water.
